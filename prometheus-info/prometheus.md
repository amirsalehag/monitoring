# prometheus exporters
* An exporter is a “translator” or “adapter” program able to collect the server native metrics (or generate its own data observing the server behavior) and re-publishing these metrics using the Prometheus metrics format and HTTP protocol transports.  
* To reduce the amount of maintenance needed to find, validate, and configure these exporters, Sysdig has created a site called [PromCat.io](https://promcat.io) where we curate the best exporters, provide detailed configuration examples, and support our customers who want to use them.
