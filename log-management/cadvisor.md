# What is cadvisor
* Cadvisor provides resource usage, performance characteristics & related information about the containers running on the machine.  
It is an open-source tool & runs as a daemon process in the background collecting, processing & aggregating useful DevOps information.  
* In Kubernetes cAdvisor is integrated into the Kubelet binary. It is pretty intelligent to auto-discover all the containers running  
in the machine & collect CPU, memory, file system & network usage statistics. It also provides a comprehensive overall machine usage  
by analyzing the root container.
